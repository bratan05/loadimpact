** Setting things up **

Clone the sources:
```
git clone git@github.com:bratan05/loadimpact.git
```

Create a new virtual environment (I suggest using the pipenv tool and python 3):
```
cd loadimpact
pipenv shell
```
This will create and activate a new environment for you. You can activate it using the same command.
